# Hey, I'm [Bipin Giri] ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a dedicated JavaScript/TypeScript developer who's enthusiastic about crafting top-notch web and mobile applications. My journey in the coding realm began with the thrill of building my first "Hello World" program, and from that point forward, I've been on an exciting journey of continual learning and growth.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Proficient in creating captivating user interfaces using React.js and Next.js. I excel in crafting responsive designs, managing state with Redux, and using modern CSS-in-JS solutions for seamless styling.

- **Backend**: I've got your backend needs covered with Node.js and Nest.js. Whether it's architecting RESTful APIs or developing robust GraphQL endpoints, I relish building scalable and maintainable server-side solutions.

- **Mobile**: My expertise extends to mobile app development using React Native. I've successfully transformed ideas into cross-platform apps that deliver a native experience on both iOS and Android.

## DevOps and Infrastructure

Apart from development, I'm also well-versed in DevOps practices and cloud infrastructure. I have experience setting up and configuring virtual private servers (VPS) on platforms like EC2. I'm comfortable with light shell scripting and creating scheduled tasks using cron jobs.
